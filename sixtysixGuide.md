This is a quick guide to playing the [sixty six webapp](sixtysix.html).  For more detailed rules, see [www.pagat.com/marriage/66.html](http://www.pagat.com/marriage/66.html).  

### Card Rank and Value

This game uses a 24 card deck, with aces high and nines low.  The ten is the second highest card in each suit, after the ace. Cards taken in tricks are worth points given by the values in the table below. 

| &nbsp; Rank &nbsp; | &nbsp; A &nbsp; | &nbsp; 10 &nbsp; | &nbsp; K &nbsp; | &nbsp; Q &nbsp; | &nbsp; J &nbsp;| &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| &nbsp; Value | 11 | 10 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 0 |

### Play 

The goal is to win 66 points before your opponent does.  During the first half of the game, players do not need to follow suit. When all of the cards from the stack have been drawn, or after someone closes the stack, the rules change and players must follow suit and they must win the trick if they can.  If a player cannot follow suit, then they must play a trump card if they have one. You also can't score for marriages in sixty six after the stack is closed or empty, unlike in [schnapsen](schnapsen.html).  

Here is how the game handles the following situations. 

**Marriages** If you have both the king and queen of a suit, and lead with either, it automatically scores a marriage. A regular marriage is worth 20 points. Royal marriages (ones in the trump suit) are worth 40 points. Note: the points only count if you win at least one trick. 

**Swapping the Trump Card** If you have the nine of trump and it is your lead, you can swap the nine with the trump card under the stack by clicking on the trump card.  

**Closing the Stack** To close the stack, click on the top card of the stack.  

**Viewing your Tricks** To see the cards you have taken, click on the pile of cards to the right of your hand.
