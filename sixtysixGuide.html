<p>This is a quick guide to playing the <a href="sixtysix.html">sixty six webapp</a>. For more detailed rules, see <a href="http://www.pagat.com/marriage/66.html">www.pagat.com/marriage/66.html</a>.</p>
<h3 id="card-rank-and-value">Card Rank and Value</h3>
<p>This game uses a 24 card deck, with aces high and nines low. The ten is the second highest card in each suit, after the ace. Cards taken in tricks are worth points given by the values in the table below.</p>

<h3 id="play">Play</h3>
<p>The goal is to win 66 points before your opponent does. During the first half of the game, players do not need to follow suit. When all of the cards from the stack have been drawn, or after someone closes the stack, the rules change and players must follow suit and they must win the trick if they can. If a player cannot follow suit, then they must play a trump card if they have one. You also can't score for marriages in sixty six after the stack is closed or empty, unlike in <a href="schnapsen.html">schnapsen</a>. If there are no cards left in the stack, then the winner of the last trick earns an extra 10 points.</p>
<p>Here is how the game handles the following situations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Marriages</strong> If you have both the king and queen of a suit, and lead with either, it automatically scores a marriage. A regular marriage is worth 20 points. Royal (trump suit) marriages are worth 40 points. Note: the points only count if you win at least one trick.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swapping the Trump Card</strong> If you have the nine of trump and it is your lead, you can swap the nine with the trump card under the stack by clicking on the trump card.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Closing the Stack</strong> To close the stack, click on the top card of the stack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Viewing your Tricks</strong> To see the cards you have taken, click on the pile of cards to the right of your hand.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>
<p>The first player to reach 66 points wins. The winner earns either 1, 2, or 3 game points, depending on how many points their opponent had at the end of the game. If a player closes the deck but fails to reach 66 first, they lose. In that case the non-closer wins 2 game points or 3 game points if they had not won any tricks when the stack was closed. The chart below determines how many game points the winner earns.</p>
